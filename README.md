# React Clock using useEffect
This is a simple clock app built with React, utilizing the useEffect hook to update the time every second.

## How it works
The Clock component uses the useState hook to maintain the current time as a state variable. The useEffect hook is used to run a callback every second using setInterval. The callback function updates the time state with the current time and formats it as a string.

The updated time is then displayed in the component's render method.

## Getting started
To run the app, clone the repository and run the following commands in your terminal:

Copy code
```npm install```
```npm start```
Then, navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the app in action.
